# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
original_string = "google"
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]
if original_string == reversed_string:
    print(f'"{original_string}" is a palindrome.')
else:
    print(f'"{original_string}" is not a palindrome.')
```
## Output

## Result
The program was successfully executed. It correctly identified that the string "google" is not a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version ("elgoog"). The output matches the expected result.
